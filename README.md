# Content Type Usage Report for Episerver
This package adds new option to Episerver's Report menu, enabling a user to select a content type (that has an instance created in the cms) 
and view a list of all instances of content created with that type. Entries link to the cms edit interface for easy editing of found content. 

This was created to help find content to test when changes have been made to a specific content type, but is also useful for tracking down instances
of block types for reorganization in the cms.

# Installation
Install the package from nuget - Reingold.Episerver.Reports.ContentTypeUsage
